## Overview
I am excited to present my first project after approximately one month of learning HTML and CSS. Although the design may not closely resemble the original challenge requirements, I have made significant progress in implementing the desired layout.

While the project is mostly responsive, I encountered a minor issue with the mobile view. The X axis slightly overflows, which I plan to address and correct. Additionally, I noticed that the style underneath the hero image does not extend fully to the right viewport, and I will work on rectifying this.

Despite these challenges, I am proud of my progress and look forward to further improving my skills in future projects.

## My process
Instead of coding the entire HTML structure at once, I followed a step-by-step approach. I began by coding a portion of the HTML and then proceeded to write the corresponding CSS. This iterative process allowed me to complete the entire project gradually, focusing on small sections at a time. By adopting this method, I was able to avoid the task of writing the entire HTML first and then styling the entire page all at once.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  const paragraph = queBtn[i].nextElementSibling;
  paragraph.classList.toggle("show");
}
```

### Continued development

I want to take a mobile-first approach from now on. Using utility classes can reduce the amount of code and make the CSS file shorter. Therefore, I plan to use utility classes in future projects and will try to avoid overwriting too many things.

### Useful resources
